Welcome, here is the project organisation:

_ A embedded database is use (h2) and all the data of the exam are build/loaded via schema.sql and data.sql present in resources folder.
_ The flying plan is return as a json output, un array containing each flightplan for each order, thus, the endpoint is http://localhost:8080/api/flyplan
_ The project need a lot of improvement and test writing, but I really was out of time, and make it last sunday afternoon.

Enjoy :)
